# Hi there! 👋  

I'm Lucas Leone, a software developer with 4 years of experience building scalable and high-performance web applications. I specialize in backend development using Django REST Framework and work daily with tools that enhance system reliability and performance.

🚀 I'm the founder of [Turnero Online](https://turnero-online.me), a modern appointment management platform that helps businesses streamline their scheduling process and improve client experience.

⚙️ I'm passionate about backend development and system architecture. My main stack includes:
- **Django REST Framework** for building robust APIs  
- **Celery** for asynchronous task processing  
- **Docker** for containerization and reproducible environments  
- **PostgreSQL** for reliable and efficient data management  

🎯 I enjoy optimizing performance, designing scalable systems, and automating workflows that make development more efficient.

🎓 I'm currently studying Systems Engineering at the National Technological University (UTN).
