# Hi there! üëã  

I'm Lucas Leone, a software developer with 4 years of experience building scalable and high-performance web applications. I specialize in backend development using Django REST Framework and work daily with tools that enhance system reliability and performance.

üöÄ I'm the founder of [Turnero Online](https://turnero-online.me), a modern appointment management platform that helps businesses streamline their scheduling process and improve client experience.

üíº Currently, I'm working at:
- [**InformeMedico**](https://informemedico.com.ar/): A medical imaging visualization platform, built with **Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView**, focused on secure handling and real-time interaction of healthcare data.
- [**BataEDU**](https://bataedu.com/): An educational platform for learning programming, with a backend in **Elixir & Phoenix** and a modern frontend built with **Vite, TypeScript, and TanStack**.  

‚öôÔ∏è I'm passionate about backend development and system architecture. My main stack includes:
- **Django REST Framework** for building robust APIs  
- **Celery** for asynchronous task processing  
- **Docker** for containerization and reproducible environments  
- **PostgreSQL** for reliable and efficient data management  
- **Elixir & Phoenix** for highly concurrent and fault-tolerant systems  
- **LiveView** for real-time interactive interfaces  
- **Vite, TypeScript & TanStack** for modern and efficient frontend development  

üéØ I enjoy optimizing performance, designing scalable systems, and automating workflows that make development more efficient.

üéì I'm currently studying Systems Engineering at the National Technological University (UTN).
